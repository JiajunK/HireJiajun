                <h2>#1: She graduated with a 3.71 GPA from the University of Hawaii</h2>
                <p>Yeah, I’m sure all of your applicants have a college degree, but how many of them have 2? Let alone, how many of them have a high GPA? In May 2021, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in Japanese. She was consistently on the Dean’s list throughout college as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secB">
                <h2>#2: She speaks 3 languages, fluently.</h2>
                <p>You read that correctly. She is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and English. Looking to expand your company overseas? Look no further. Looking to have international clients? I got your back. Did I mention she can speak, read, and write in all three languages? She got her JLPT N1 certification at the ripe age of 17 years old to prove her abilities (DLPT Chinese coming soon!)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secC">
                <h2>#3: She has over 6 years of customer service experience</h2>
                <p>Okay, but how does that relate to your job? Well, people skills are important no matter where you go. Unless you are a company of 1 person and Jiajun will be the only employee, she's going to talk to people. You can teach someone how to code but you can’t teach someone how to talk to people. Because she has worked with and for people for the past 6 years, you can rest assured she can talk to her team members confidently, politely, and respectfully.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secA">
                <h2>#4: She lived in three different countries</h2>
                <p>This ties in hand-in-hand with the previous section: because she has lived in three different countries, she is very accepting of diversities. Jiajun believes in equal employee opportunities and will never discriminate against her management or peers due to their race, disabilities, beliefs, gender, or anything else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secB">
                <h2>#5: She has a super flexible sleep schedule</h2>
                <p>6am shifts, 2pm shifts, grave shifts, been there, done that. Jiajun has done all the different shifts under the sun while still being in school, meaning if you want her to work a 2am to 11am shift, she will probably do it. Timezone virtually means nothing for her. Still looking to expand overseas? </p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secC">
                <h2>#6: She enjoys creative media</h2>
                <p>In middle school, she took a multimedia course (thanks Mr. Sugano!) and every since then she has been playing with Photoshop. Not only is she fluent in the Photoshop world, she can also do some 3D modeling on Blender. Did I also mention she loves video editing on Premiere Pro? She has made over 10 signage and print-outs at the Prince Waikiki which is currently given out to hundreds of customers daily. </p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secA">
                <h2>#7: She is a fresh college graduate</h2>
                <p>Why should you hire a fresh college graduate over someone with years of experience you ask? Well, she is not super set and stone in her ways like programming seniors just yet. This means you can mold and shape her coding style to whatever style your company requires. Do you prefer your curly brackets on the same line or on the new line? Jiajun doesn’t care, she just graduated! Made a mistake and you need to chew her out? Jiajun will swallow her pride and take in the criticism, afterall, she is new.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class= "secB">
                <h2>#8: She loves to eat healthily and exercise</h2>
                <p>What does this have to do with anything? It means she will live a very long age without calling out sick every often. On her freetime she will go lifting and running. Homemade food is her calling. You don’t have to worry about Jiajun calling out sick all the time and she won’t retire until she is 90* years old.

                <h2>#9: Vaccinated and have a US passport</h2>
                <p>Don’t worry, she has 3 shots of vaccine and a US passport, so you don’t have to worry about all these HR issues. She will not require sponsorship to work in the US.</p>

            <div class= "secA">
                <h2>#10: She worked pretty hard on this website
                </h2>
                <p>If you scrolled this far down then you realize how much work is put into this. This is probably longer than any cover letter you have read so far. Thank you for visiting this website and I hope to hear back from you! </p>
